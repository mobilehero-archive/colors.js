# üõë IMPORTANT! üõë

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a fork of the original `colors` module from before the author went rogue and introduced an intentional Denial of Service (DoS) into the latest codebase.  DO NOT USE the original package `colors` any longer.  This branch is taken from a commit that was made before the incident occurred.
